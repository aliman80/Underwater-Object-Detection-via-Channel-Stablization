# Underwater Object Detection via Channel Stabilization  

The complex marine environment exacerbates the challenges of object detection manifold. With the advent of the modern era, marine trash presents a growing danger to the aquatic ecosystem, and it has always been challenging to address this issue effectively. Therefore, there is a significant need to **precisely detect marine waste and locate it accurately** in challenging underwater surroundings.  

To ensure the safety of the marine environment, underwater object detection is a crucial tool to mitigate the harmful impact of waste. This project explains **image enhancement strategies** and presents experiments exploring the best detection backbones after applying these methods.

## üåä Key Contributions  
- **Channel Stabilization Technique**  
  - A lightweight image enhancement procedure to reduce haze and color cast (dominance of blue) in underwater images.  
  - Improves visibility and contrast, especially for **multi-scale objects**.  

- **Integration with Detectron2**  
  - Evaluated multiple backbones (e.g., **RetinaNet**, **Faster R-CNN**) on the [TrashCan dataset](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/216171).  
  - Applied **augmentation techniques** and a **sharpening filter** to highlight object boundaries for better recognition.  

- **Comparisons with Deformable Transformer (Deformable DETR)**  
  - Benchmarked our method against transformer-based detectors.  
  - Channel stabilization + augmentation on top of the best-performing backbone yielded consistent improvements.

## üìà Results  

- On **TrashCan 1.0 (Instance version)**:  
  - **+9.53% absolute improvement** in Average Precision (AP) for small-sized objects.  
  - **+7% absolute gain** in bounding box AP compared to baseline.  

- Demonstrated enhanced detection of **small-scale marine debris** in cluttered and low-visibility underwater scenes.

## üîß Methodology  

### 1. Preprocessing with RGHS  
Preprocessing input images using the **Relative Global Histogram Stretching (RGHS)** method.
